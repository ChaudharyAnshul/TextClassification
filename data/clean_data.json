This robust earnings generation combined with the execution of our capital strategy allowed us to exceed our CET1 target of 13% one quarter early, and we have the ability to resume stock buybacks this quarter, as we deem appropriate. Looking further ahead, we still await details of the Basel III finalization package, but we will manage to the new requirements as we have demonstrated in the past.\u201d Dimon continued: \u201cOur lines of business performed well in the quarter, and we continued to see momentum in our areas of strategic focus. In Consumer & Community Banking, debit and credit card sales were up 9%, while card loans were up 19% with total revolving balances now back to pre-pandemic levels. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Markets revenue rose 7% as client activity remained strong in Fixed Income. Global Investment Banking fees were down significantly in a challenging environment, although we maintained our #1 ranking in 2022. Commercial Banking loans were up 14% on new loan originations and higher revolver utilization. And in Asset & Wealth Management, revenue increased 3% as higher net interest income more than offset the impact of lower market levels.\u201d Dimon added: \u201cThe U.S. economy currently remains strong with consumers still spending excess cash and businesses healthy. However, we still do not know the ultimate effect of the headwinds coming from geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation that is eroding purchasing power and has pushed interest rates higher, and the unprecedented quantitative tightening. We remain vigilant and are prepared for whatever happens, so we can serve our customers, clients and communities around the world across a broad range of economic environments.\u201d Dimon concluded: \u201cAs a result of the investments we have made over the years and our dedication to clients, the Firm is in a position of strength as the market leader in U.S. retail deposits, credit cards, business banking, Payments, Markets, investment banking and multifamily lending as some examples. But we will not rest here, and we remain committed to investing in the franchise and innovating. The importance of these investments and investing through cycles was particularly evident this year, as we generated a robust ROTCE of 18% even after sharply accelerating our investments in the business. In 2022, we extended credit and raised $2.4 trillion in capital for small and large businesses, governments and U.S. consumers. Finally, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our employees and how they work to support our customers and communities and earn their trust every single day.\u201d|.","label_encoded":2},{"text":"(1)| Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.|.","label_encoded":2},{"text":" -- Arista Networks, Inc.

The amendment provides an initial screen that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, an integrated set of assets and activities would not represent a business. If the screen is not met, the set must include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contributes to the ability to create outputs for the set to represent a business. The amendment also narrows the definition of the term \"output\" and requires the transfer of an organized work force when outputs do not exist. The amended guidance may result in more transactions being accounted for as assets in the future with the impact to our results of operations dependent on the individual facts and circumstances of each transaction.","label_encoded":2},{"text":"\/s\/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP|.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP|.\nMidland, Michigan|.\nFebruary\u00a07, 2020|.","label_encoded":1},{"text":"March 5, 2018 ","label_encoded":1},{"text":"\u2022| Altria signed and closed a $12.8 billion investment in JUUL, the U.S. leader in e-vapor, representing a 35% economic interest.
